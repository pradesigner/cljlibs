# cljlibs

Various clojure libraries and tools are examined and experimented with here.

## Description
Clojure has a large set of libraries giving the language great versatility. We create mini-tutorials for many of these so we can have quick access in projects.

Libraries examined in this repo so far:
- [TMD](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset)  
  tech.ml.dataset (TMD) is a Clojure library for tabular data
  processing similar to Python's Pandas, or R's data.table. It
  supports pragmatic data-intensive work on the JVM by providing
  powerful abstractions that simplify implementing efficient solutions
  to real problems.
- Tablecloth
  Dataset (data frame) manipulation API for the tech.ml.dataset library.
- [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive)
  Enlive is a selector-based (Ã  la CSS) templating library for Clojure.
- [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)
  Fast library for rendering HTML in Clojure.
